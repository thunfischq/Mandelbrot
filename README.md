# Mandelbrot

A simple renderer for the Mandelbrot set written in C++17. Serves no purpose besides looking cool.

# Dependencies

Requires SFML library. On Ubuntu, install it via:

    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

For anything else, the installation paths in the Makefile will probably need to be adjusted.

# Run

Compile the binary by running the Makefile:

    make

and then run the executable:

    ./bin/Mandelbrot
